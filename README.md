# Design-of-Verification-of-FIFO-and-AXI---Stream-based-memory
Implemented an AXI-Stream based memory interface for efficient master-memory data transfer. Developed a SystemVerilog testbench using mailbox-based communication with generator and driver classes. Verified read/write operations through simulation ensuring data integrity and protocol compliance.
